Allows you to use notion with GNOME 3 Session infrastructure

-- this is a gross hack 

## What do I get by installing it?
- In order to manage GNOME things such as your cursor/icon, (GTK) themes and online accounts.
- A friendly bridge that keeps your stuff from GNOME in an i3 environment.
- Useful for people that are getting started with i3wm, but don't want to uninstall their current desktop environment.
